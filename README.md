better performance when rendring complex objects. [A detailed comparison can be find here.](http://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-choose-between-canvas-and-svg/).
While SVG's performance decreases when number of drawing objects increase, the performance 
of HTML5 suffers when canvas size became bigger. [A nice performace comparison
can be found in this article](http://smus.com/canvas-vs-svg-performance/).
