the browser. As part of the DOM, SVG can be created with markup and modified by CSS or 
programmaticaly through script, it provide better scalability and animation support.
HTML5 Canvas programmatically rendering of bitmap images through JavaScript API, it has
better performance when rendering complex objects. [A detailed comparison can be find here.](http://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-choose-between-canvas-and-svg/).
While SVG's performance decreases when number of drawing objects increase, the performance 
of HTML5 suffers when canvas size became bigger. [A nice performance comparison
can be found in this article](http://smus.com/canvas-vs-svg-performance/).
